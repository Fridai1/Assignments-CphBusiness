# Assignments-CphBusiness

### Assignment 6
***
### Note: I found this assignment a little confusing and as such i have tried my best to fullfill the reguirements for the assignment.

**the first requirement:**
* Keep track of each variable in the program and which possible values
it can have in the state. In rare cases we know the exact value of a
variable, but mostly, we only know a span of possible values or maybe
only the fact that the variable is initialized.

I believe we have done so, if you inspect the code, it should be clear that we dont always know the value of x or y, but we can determine from the if checks, which range it must have.

**the second requirement:**
* Be partially ordered.

to be partially ordered it has to be:
* reflexive
* antisymmetric
* transitive

Im a little unsure about this one, we have tried to make it so that i would fullfill all the above requirements to be partially ordered, if we are wrong we would love to know where.

**thirs requirement**
* Support local minimum (intersection) and local maximum (union) between states (will be explained in class).
i wasnt able to find any information on this in the slides or in the assignment description, so i have taken it to mean that the variables has to be able to intersect and be joined, if so then i believe we have fullfilled this requirement as well.
