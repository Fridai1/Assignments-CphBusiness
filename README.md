# Assignments-CphBusiness

### This Assignment was originally in Java, but due to various errors and my limited knownledge of Java, i have decided to port it to C#, as best as i can.

Now my initial issue is that the program has superp performance, that is to say it completes with a tally of each letters concurrence in a split second. I find that trivial to improve, while there are multiple small tweaks i could perform to improve the performance, i wont have anyway to measure any real impact, if any.
