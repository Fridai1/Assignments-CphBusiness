# Assignments-CphBusiness

### This Assignment was originally in Java, but due to various errors and my limited knownledge of Java, i have decided to port it to C#, as best as i can.

***

Now my initial issue is that the program has superp performance, that is to say it completes with a tally of each letters concurrence in a split second. I find that trivial to improve, while there are multiple small tweaks i could perform to improve the performance, i wont have anyway to measure any real impact, if any.

## How to run it

#### if you wish to run this in debug mode:
* first you gotta copy the project
* Edit the path to the local .txt file.
* run.

#### if you wish to just see it in action:
* download the Exe file and run it.
