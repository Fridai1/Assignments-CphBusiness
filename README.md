# Assignments-CphBusiness

## This Assignment is about message brokers.
***
### I have created with Nikolaj Jensen a flight booking system.

there are two projects a producer and a consumer.

you only need to run one instance of the producer, you can send 4 types of campaigns to the consumers. By default the campaign stated in the assignment is sent, you can futher send campaigns within 3 topics:
* Winter
* Summer
* Autumn

When you start a consumer, you choose a topic you are interested in(one of the above). once that is done, you wil only recieve campaigns if one is send that matches your interest.

Once a campaign has been received you can choose to confirm it or pass on it, in either case you are put back into recieving mode, and you can continue to receive campaigns.
